# Shuying_Liu_SI507_final_project
In this final project, I built a program to help users to select cars through choosing their preferences.
A "data_cleaned.csv" database file is needed for this program to run successfully.
Users can run the program and interact with the program through inputing commands as directed by the program. At the end, users can choose bar charts, box plots or maps to be presented.
